# AI-Generated-Video-Creation-using-Facial-Integration
Creating an AI-generated video using your facial likeness alongside a reference video requires combining several techniques and tools, such as facial recognition, deep learning, and video generation. The process typically involves multiple steps, including:

    Facial Recognition and Mapping: Extracting your facial features and applying them to the reference video.
    Deepfake or Face-Swapping: Using AI models to swap faces in a video.
    Video Generation: Combining the mapped facial features with the reference video to create a new video.

Below is a high-level Python approach to creating such a video using AI. Note that using such technology should always be done ethically and with proper consent, especially when dealing with sensitive facial data.

Here’s an outline of the code flow using deep learning libraries like DeepFace, face_recognition, and popular deepfake models like First Order Motion Model, or libraries like Deepfake and DeepFaceLab. You’ll need a setup for deepfake tools, access to GPU resources, and datasets.
High-Level Steps:

    Facial Feature Extraction
    Training or Using Pre-trained Deepfake Model
    Video Creation

import cv2
import dlib
import numpy as np
from deepface import DeepFace  # Library to analyze faces
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, concatenate_videoclips

# Step 1: Extract facial landmarks
def extract_facial_landmarks(image_path):
    detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()
    predictor = dlib.shape_predictor("shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat")  # You need to download this pre-trained model
    
    # Read the image
    img = cv2.imread(image_path)
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    faces = detector(gray)
    
    landmarks = []
    for face in faces:
        landmarks.append(predictor(gray, face))
    
    return landmarks

# Step 2: Facial Recognition using DeepFace
def get_face_embedding(image_path):
    result = DeepFace.represent(image_path, model_name="VGG-Face", enforce_detection=False)
    return result[0]["embedding"]

# Step 3: Map face onto the reference video using AI-based model
def apply_face_to_video(input_video_path, output_video_path, facial_model, reference_video_path):
    video = VideoFileClip(input_video_path)
    reference_video = VideoFileClip(reference_video_path)
    
    def process_frame(frame):
        # Apply facial model here (Deepfake or face-swapping logic)
        # Assuming you have a method to swap faces based on the facial model
        # Apply AI-generated face swapping or transformation
        # Placeholder: return frame unchanged, modify based on your implementation
        return frame
    
    new_video = video.fl_image(process_frame)
    new_video.write_videofile(output_video_path, codec="libx264")

# Step 4: Generate and combine
def generate_video_with_face(input_image_path, input_video_path, reference_video_path, output_video_path):
    # Extract facial features from the image
    facial_landmarks = extract_facial_landmarks(input_image_path)
    embedding = get_face_embedding(input_image_path)
    
    # Apply the face model and create a video
    apply_face_to_video(input_video_path, output_video_path, embedding, reference_video_path)

# Example Usage:
generate_video_with_face("my_face.jpg", "input_video.mp4", "reference_video.mp4", "output_video.mp4")

Explanation:

    Facial Landmarks Extraction: We use dlib to detect and extract facial landmarks from an image, which helps in mapping the face correctly.
    Face Embedding: DeepFace is used to extract a face embedding, a numerical representation of the face, which helps in matching and swapping the faces effectively.
    Video Editing: moviepy is used to handle the video processing, where we manipulate each frame of the input video to apply the AI-generated face.

AI Deepfake Tools:

For realistic AI-based face swapping, models like First Order Motion Model, DeepFaceLab, or DeepFake tools are often used in the industry. These models use pre-trained deep learning techniques to map faces onto a reference video.

    First Order Motion Model: A deep learning model that generates face swapping using a reference image and a motion capture video. You could modify the process_frame method to apply such a model for real-time face mapping.
    DeepFaceLab: A specialized tool for deepfake generation, which you can use to train a model based on your own images and apply it to a video.

Requirements:

    OpenCV for image and video processing.
    DeepFace for facial recognition and embeddings.
    dlib for detecting facial landmarks.
    MoviePy for video editing.
    Pre-trained models like VGG-Face for facial recognition, and shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat for facial landmark detection.

Important Notes:

    Ethics: Ensure you're following ethical practices when using facial recognition and deepfake technology. You should always have consent from individuals before using their facial data.
    Hardware Requirements: Deepfake models can be computationally intensive, so having a GPU would be necessary for training and applying such models in real-time.

This code provides a basic framework, but for more accurate and refined deepfake video generation, you would need to use dedicated deepfake libraries like DeepFaceLab, Faceswap, or First Order Motion Model for creating realistic AI-generated content.
